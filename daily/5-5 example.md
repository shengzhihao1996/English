'The Artist' is just like one of those old films. This romance was
made in gorgeous black and white and takes place in the 1920s. And,
just like the old films, there's no talking. There are only a few
subtitles. But it's certainly not a remake of one of the old films
from the 1920s. Remember how some of those old movies had really bad
acting? Well, the acting in 'The Artist' is brilliant, and actor
Berenice Bejo is incredible. This movie also has an original plot.
'The Artist' shows us what happens when a famous person has really
bad luck. I won't tell you how it ends â€“ see 'The Artist' for
yourself.

JENNY: I just saw another Joseph Fiennes movie.
LUCAS: Which one  ? Is it an action  movie?
JENNY: Uh, 'Shakespeare in Love.' It's a romantic comedy. 
But I think that  there's some good history in it, too. 
It's funny because Shakespeare can't think of any good ideas. 
I thought  it was quite entertaining.
LUCAS: Me, too. I don't usually like  romances, 
but that's one of my favorite movies. It's an old one.
JENNY: Yeah, it's quite old, but it's still good.
LUCAS: Mm-hmm. Did you watch it with your kids?
JENNY: No, but I think I could  show this one to my kids.

TIM: Wow. Amazing. 'Shaun of the Dead.' I can't believe that movie was made  with so little money.
MEGAN: Oh? How much money did they spend  ?
TIM: $6.1 million. It seemed like it was created  for $50 million.
MEGAN: But $6.1 million is a lot of money!
TIM: Not really. Most Hollywood films cost, like, $100 million, or more.
MEGAN: Huh. How did they do it?
TIM: Well, it was directed by  Edgar Wright. He's brilliant.
MEGAN: Yeah?
TIM: He said they weren't given  much money, and they were told  to spend it
carefully. So he was really careful and worked really hard.

I just saw 'Rear Window.' What an amazing movie! 
'Rear Window' was made in 1954 and was directed by the fanmous Alfred Hitchcock. 
'Rear Window' is a dark story, like most Hitchcock movies. L.B. is palyed by james Stewart. 
L.B. is a photographer, but his leg is broken. He has to stay home, so he watches his neighbors through their windows. 
I felt sorry for his poor neighbors! Soon, L.B. begins useing his camera to fight evil. 
I saw the remake in 1998, but it's not the same. Daryl Hannah's acting was dreadful!
