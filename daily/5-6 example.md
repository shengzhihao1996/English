HAYLEY: So, I just went shopping, and there were just too many amazing clothes. 
In the first shop, I found this classic pair of jeans.They are so cute. 
I also tried on a skirt, but it was too loose. 
Then, at the second place, I tried some interesting jeans, but I decided they were way too baggy. 
But I did find a skirt that is pretty, and tight. It looks great. Then, I couldn't believe it: 
I also went to a hat store and bought this very stylish hat. Funny, because there were some hats there that were, 
like, totally out of style. At the last shop, I tried on two dresses. 
One is very formal, and the other one, here â€“ it's pretty casual. What do you think?
