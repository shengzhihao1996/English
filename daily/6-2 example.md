RECEPTIONIST: What seems to be the problem?
JENNY: Well, I've been  vomiting, and I have diarrhea.
RECEPTIONIST: Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that. How long has this been going on  ?
JENNY: For  three days.
RECEPTIONIST: Have you been experiencing  any other problems?
JENNY: I've  been feeling really tired for a few days now. I haven't  been sleeping well.

I feel terrible. I didn't sleep last night because I had a bad fever  . 
I was just too hot! I have a bad cough  , too – maybe because I smoke? 
My colleagues always complain about the noise I make, 
but I can't answer them because I have a sore throat  and I can't speak. 
I didn't eat all day because I felt nauseous  and I had a stomachache  , 
and every time I wanted to stand up, I couldn't because I was so dizzy  .

DOCTOR: How long have you been  feeling bad?
PATIENT: Since  the weekend.
DOCTOR: And how have  you been feeling?
PATIENT: Tired, and for  the last few days I've been feeling  nauseous, too.
DOCTOR: Have you been taking  anything?
PATIENT: Yes. I've been taking medicine since I started feeling sick.

DOCTOR: I'm going to write you a prescription for some medication  . The dosage  is two tablets, twice a day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You aren't allergic  to anything, are you?
PATIENT: No, I'm not.
DOCTOR: Good. And you're not currently  taking any other medication?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Great. Take it easy when you have an appetite again – nothing spicy  for the first week, OK? 
By the way, I'm sorry to say your insurance  won't cover this. You'll need to pay for it yourself.
