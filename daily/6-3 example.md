Our company has a number of problems. We need to have better communication  between management and staff. 
If employee morale  is poor, we will not do well. Also, a lack of innovation  will make people not want to buy our products. 
We have to keep costs  down so we have the money to buy the latest technology. 
We also have to watch what the competition  is doing. We are not alone in this business.

JUSTIN: I have terrible insomnia  . I feel so tired at work.
AMY: Can I give you some advice?
JUSTIN: Yeah, sure.
AMY: Well, don't  eat dinner too late. 
And you had better  not drink coffee in the afternoon and evening. Instead, drink lots of water.
JUSTIN: Right.
AMY: Also, get some exercise after work. 
You ought to go for a long walk or maybe go to the gym. Oh, and this is really important: 
You had better not  watch TV in bed. You ought to  read a book. That always helps me sleep.
JUSTIN: Thanks for the advice.
AMY: Oh, one more thing. You should open your window. Fresh air is great for sleeping.

Quitting smoking is very, very difficult. It's an addiction. Some people can't do it alone. 
My advice is that you ought to see your doctor. Your doctor can give you medicine to help.  
Also, when you talk on the phone or drink coffee or alcohol, you had better eat something. 
That will keep your mouth busy.

The Clayton Harelson Company made beautiful motorcycles that were popular around the world. 
It cost a lot to make them in the US, so the motorcycles were expensive. 
Problems began when other companies, in other countries, started making similar motorcycles. 
Company management decided they had two choices. 
One solution was to move the factory to a less expensive country. 
Another possibility was to have fewer workers in the factory and spend a lot of money on the latest technology to make the motorcycles.

I worked for a company that made sunglasses. The glasses were really nice, but the employees weren't happy. 
The communication between management and employees was very bad. The boss didn't know what to do. 
Finally, the boss decided that the solution was to have a team meeting with management and employees every week. 
That was a very good idea. The communication got better, and employee morale also got better.
