个人问题
如果你无法放弃止做某事，你就是对它addicted，或你对它有了一种addiction，下面就是一些常见的沉溺。
He's addicted to cigarettes.	他有烟瘾。                
She's addicted to coffee.	她喝咖啡上瘾。
They're addicted to gambling.	他们嗜赌成瘾。
He's addicted to alcohol. He's an alcoholic.	他嗜酒成瘾。他是个酒鬼。

以下是一些其他常见的个人问题。
She has financial problems.	她碰到了一些经济上的问题。
He has a weight problem. He's overweight.	他有体重问题。他非常胖。
I have a problem sleeping. I have insomnia.	我睡不着觉。我患有失眠症。
They have marital problems.	他们遇到了婚姻问题。

情态动词 'ought to'和'had better'
你可以使用情态动词 ought to 和 had better 来给予个人建议。Had better 语气强于ought to，在提出强烈的建议时使用。
He's very overweight. He ought to lose some weight.	他很胖，应该减减肥。
Your health is very poor. You had better quit smoking.	你身体很不好，最好把烟戒了。
had better 的否定是 had better not。ought to 的否定是 ought not to，但很少使用。
You had better not start smoking. It's a terrible habit.	你最好不要开始吸烟。这个习惯很不好。
She has terrible insomnia. She ought not to drink coffee in the evening.	她严重失眠。她晚上不应该喝咖啡。
 
提出强烈建议有许多方法。学习这些不同的表达。
Make sure to get enough sleep.	务必保持充足的睡眠。
Make sure not to drink coffee at night.	晚上千万别喝咖啡。
Be sure to exercise every week.务必每周锻炼身体。
Be sure not to eat too much fast food.	务必不要吃太多快餐。
Don't start smoking.	不要开始吸烟。
You ought to give up gambling.你应该戒赌。
You had better stop smoking.	你最好戒烟。
You had better not talk to him. You're angry!	你最好别和他说话。你很生气！

与生活中其他方面一样，有时工作中也会碰到一些问题。一位员工可能需要与老板就以下方面谈话：
being late = tardiness	迟到
being disorganized	缺乏条理的
being lazy	懒惰
being sloppy	粗心
being argumentative	
being offensive	无礼

not being flexible	处事不灵活
not following instructions	不遵守指示
not working well with the team	和团队合作不愉快
not meeting deadlines	没有如期完成
 
您的个人或专业生活中可能会出现问题。公司也可能遇到问题。研究下面的常见公司问题。
Business is bad, and employee morale is low.	生意很差，而且员工士气低落。
Communication between management and staff is poor.	管理层和员工之间的沟通不畅。
There is a continuing problem of employee theft in the company.	公司里有员工盗窃的问题。
The company's costs are going up and up.	公司的开支一直在上涨。
Competition is fierce in our industry.	我们行业的竞争很激烈。
Because of terrible mismanagement, the company is in trouble.	因为管理不善，公司现在陷入困境。
The company's biggest problem is a lack of innovation.	公司最大的问题是缺乏创新。
We don't have the money to buy the latest technology.	我们没有购买最新技术的资金。

用关系代词连接两个句子。用关系代词that 代替事物。
I work for a company. The company has lots of problems.
I work for a company that has lots of problems.

在该例子中，主句I work for a company 是一个完整句，关系从句that has lots of problems 不是完整句，故不能单独成句。

记住，使用关系从句可以让你的作文和讲话更流畅，避免重复。
提出解决办法
 
使用类似表达来提出解决办法:
 
One solution could be that we hire a new manager.	一种解决办法是我们雇一位新经理。
Another possibility would be to have a team meeting.	另一种可能是开一场团队会议。
 	 
为了竭力提出解决方法，使用类似下列表达。
 
I really think that the only solution is to replace the entire management team.	我真的认为唯一的解决办法是替换整个管理团队。
The only way to solve this problem is to buy the company.	解决问题的唯一办法是买下这家公司。
I strongly suggest that we deal with this problem immediately.	我强烈建议我们即刻处理这一问题。
